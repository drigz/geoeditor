	<para>Look at the ExampleEntryPoint class in the example project for a
		basic use of the codemirror panel.</para>

	<para>
		The initial configuration can be set with the Config object.
		<br />
		It behaves like a key-value set, most common keys are provided as
		static strings in the Config class. See the codemirror website for a
		detailed description of what all these options do.
	</para>

	<para>
		You can also change these options live once the widget is created by
		getting the wrapper object from the panel:
		<code>
			CodeMirrorPanel panel = new CodeMirrorPanel();
			...

			CodeMirrorWrapper editor = panel.getEditor();

			editor.setOption(Config.MODE, "json");
  		</code>
		Some convenience setters and getters are provided. The most important
		one of which will be the 'getContent()'
		which retrieves the text that
		was typed into the editor.
		<code>
			CodeMirrorPanel panel = new CodeMirrorPanel();
			...

			CodeMirrorWrapper editor = panel.getEditor();

			String result =
			editor.getContent();
  		</code>
	</para>
	
	<para>
	If you wish to use a custom theme or addon, the best place to add the is your 'Application.gwt.xml'. 
	Add them like you would any other javascript or css resource.<br />
	Look at the codemirror samples and just add the same js and css resources to your module.
