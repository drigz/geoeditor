/**
 * Test annotation which indicates that the {@link org.springframework.context.ApplicationContext ApplicationContext}
 * associated with a test should be reloaded instead of taken from the cache:
 * <ul>
 * <li>before the current test, when declared at the method level</li>
 * <li>before each test method in the current test class, when declared at the class level with class mode set to
 * {@link ClassMode#BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD}</li>
 * <li>before the current test class, when declared at the class level with class mode set to
 * {@link ClassMode#BEFORE_CLASS BEFORE_CLASS}</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Use this annotation to ensure that a test is supplied with a new context. If a tests fails without this annotation,
 * it means that some other test is making the context dirty. A better solution may therefore be to track down the other
 * test and adding a DirtiesContext annotation to it.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <code>&#064;ReloadContext</code> may be used as a class-level and method-level annotation within the same class. In
 * such scenarios, the <code>ApplicationContext</code> will be marked as <em>dirty</em> before any such annotated method
 * as well as before the entire class. If the {@link ClassMode} is set to {@link ClassMode#BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD
 * BEFORE_EACH_TEST_METHOD}, the context will be marked dirty before each test method in the class.
