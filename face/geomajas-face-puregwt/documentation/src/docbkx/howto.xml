    <title>Adding a map to a classic GWT layout</title>

    <para>The MapPresenter class not only acts as the Presenter in the MVP
    (Model-View-Presenter) model but also gives access to the View by
    implementing the IsWidget interface. As a widget, it can be added to any
    of the GWT layout classes with some precautions, however:<itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>The parent widget should implement ProvidesResize</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>The size of the map has to be set explicitly</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist><programlisting>ResizeLayoutPanel panel = new ResizeLayoutPanel();
mapPresenter.setSize(100,100);
panel.setWidget(mapPresenter);</programlisting>If the panel is resizable, a
    custom resize handler should be registered to set the size whenever a
    resizing event occurs.</para>

  <section>
    <title>Adding a map to a GWT 2.0 layout</title>

    <para>A special MapLayout class is provided for adding a map to a GWT 2.0
    layout class (class that have Layout in their name and follow a sizing
    hierarchy). No special resize handling is needed for this case:</para>

    <programlisting>MapLayoutPanel mapLayout = new MapLayoutPanel();
mapLayout.setPresenter(mapPresenter);
RootLayoutPanel.get().add(layout); // fills the complete browser view</programlisting>
