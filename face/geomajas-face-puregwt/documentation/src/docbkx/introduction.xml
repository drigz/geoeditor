  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The PureGWT face is an AJAX client for the Geomajas Server, based upon
  the Google Web Toolkit. The goal of this client is to provide a clean
  mapping API for the web.</para>

  <sect1>
    <title>Thin client</title>

    <para>Since the Geomajas Server is perfectly capable of safeguarding your
    domain model or executing complex tasks, this client can focus more on the
    map presentation than business logic. This already makes the PureGWT face
    a real thin client. Take also the use of the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) into
    account and this client becomes even thinner.</para>

    <para>The Google Web Toolkit is a Java to JavaScript compiler, that
    compiles only the code that you're actually using. So instead of having to
    download entire JavaScript libraries of which you're only using a small
    portion, a GWT application contains only code that is actually used.
    Secondly, GWT provides a lot of tools for further optimizing the way your
    applications are constructed. It provides automatic obfuscation, resource
    bundling (combining resources so that less requests are needed to loads
    them all), etc.</para>

    <para>As a result of all this optimization, the memory consumption within
    the browser is also kept at a minimum, while performance is kept at
    maximum.</para>
  </sect1>

    <title>Mobile vs desktop</title>

    <para>Although aimed towards mobile devices, the PureGWT face is perfectly
    suitable for both desktop and mobile environments. As mentioned above, the
    initial footprint is as small as possible (easily a factor 10 smaller than
    other frameworks). On top of this, the PureGWT face is also designed to
    keep client-server bandwidth to a minimum, by providing caching
    mechanisms, lazy loading, etc.</para>
