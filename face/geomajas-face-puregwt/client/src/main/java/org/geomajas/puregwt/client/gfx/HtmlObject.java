 * will create an HTML element in the constructor and set as many style info as is provided. Also all HtmlObjects will
 * have an absolute positioning.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * All getters and setters work immediately on the underlying HTML element for performance reasons. Extensions of this
 * class can represent individual HTML tags such as images, but also groups (DIV). In this case of a group (see
 * HtmlContainer) it is possible to attach multiple other HtmlObjects to create a tree structure.
