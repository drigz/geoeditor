/**
 * <p>
 * Container for {@link HtmlObject}s. This class is an extension of an {@link HtmlObject} that in turn is used to store
 * a list of child {@link HtmlObject}s. In other words instances of this class represent the nodes in an HTML tree
 * structure.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The main goal for this class is to provide a container for child {@link HtmlObject}s. Through it's methods these
 * children can be managed. Note though that this class is itself also an {@link HtmlObject}, which means that this
 * class too has a fixed size and position. Child positions are always relative to this class' position.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Another important factor concerning this definition is that HtmlContainers can be transformed using a matrix
 * notation. This way it is possible to translate or zoom this container object. Rotation is not necessarily supported.
 * Implementations will specify which kinds of transformations are supported.
 * </p>
