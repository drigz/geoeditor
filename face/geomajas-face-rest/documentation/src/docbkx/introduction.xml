  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The REST face provides access to the Geomajas server through a RESTful
  protocol. The current implementation provides read-only access to the
  various vector layers configured on the server. Our protocol implementation
  was largely inspired by the <ulink
  url="http://trac.mapfish.org/trac/mapfish/wiki/MapFishProtocol">Mapfish
  protocol</ulink>, which should be in line with - or at least supported by -
  the OpenLayers client implementation. We also support clients of <ulink
  url="http://featureserver.org/">FeatureServer</ulink>, which has a much more
  limited parameterset. As far as we know, there is currently no REST standard
  for feature services, although there is some consensus on the rest
  principles (using uri extensions to determine the output format, exposing
  single features as uris, etc...). </para>
