  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>This plug-in contains a raster layer definition for accessing raster
  data from TMS servers as specified by OSGeo. See the <ulink
  url="http://wiki.osgeo.org/wiki/Tile_Map_Service_Specification">Specification</ulink>.
  Although not an official OGC specification, TMS is easy to understand and
  has the advantage of high performance.</para>

  <para>This plug-in does not support all TileMapService capabilities. It only
  supports a single TileMap configuration, represents a single layer. The
  supported TMS version is 1.0.0.</para>
