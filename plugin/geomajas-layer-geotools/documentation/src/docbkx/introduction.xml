  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The GeoTools layer allows you to build a Geomajas vector layer from
  any GeoTools DataStore object.</para>

  <para>The layer is built to be able to recover from connection problems.
  When a data source is temporary unavailable, you will get exceptions during
  the downtime, but the connection should recover once the data source is
  available again.</para>

  <para>The GeoTools layer also allows you to connect build a layer from a
  shape file. You can do this using the ShapeInMemLayer, which reads the
  entire shape file in memory. This does not allow you to save the changes
  back to disk at the moment (changes are saved in memory but will be lost
  when the application is restarted).</para>

  <para>Alternatively, you can use a GeoTools data store to access a shape
  file. This will persist changes back to disk but is not safe for concurrent
  access (which is the case in Geomajas) and thus should only be used for
  testing<footnote>
      <para>GeoTools 2.7 indexes the shape file in a data structure which does
      not handle concurrency.</para>
    </footnote>. For proper support of shape files, it is recommended to
  import the shape file into a database (PostGIS for example has a script for
  this).</para>
