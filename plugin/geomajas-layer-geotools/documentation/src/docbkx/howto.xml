    <title>How to recover from connection problems</title>

    <para>The GeoTools layer automatically recovers from connection problems.
    When the layer is created an attempt is made to connect to the data
    source. If that fails a warning is logged and the connection is
    re-established on the next attempt to use it. There is a short
    (configurable) grace period between connection attempts to ensure that the
    service is not hammered.</para>

    <para>However this only works if you use the recommended way of
    configuring the GeoTools layer, that is using the parameters property. If
    you use the datastore property then the inability to connect to the data
    source at layer creation time will result in an exception and failed
    startup (note that this way of configuring is not part of the API and may
    become impossible at any time).</para>
