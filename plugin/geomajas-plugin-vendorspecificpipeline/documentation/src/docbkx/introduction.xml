  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The vendor specific pipeline plugin provides custom pipeline
  definitions that work around some known limitations of vendor-specific data
  sources. We currently know of the following limitations:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>ESRI WFS servers have no support for passing a composite spatial
      filter consisting of multiple spatial subfilters within a WFS
      GetFeatures request</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Oracle spatial database shows poor performance when passing
      multiple spatial restrictions in an SQL query. It seems that the Oracle
      database is not as good as PostGIS in using the spatial index in an
      optimal way by e.g. reordering filters.</para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The workaround for both cases turns out to be the same. The Geomajas
  pipeline applies both a "tile bounds" filter and an "allowed area" filter to
  the layer. By splitting this up in a two-stage process and only applying the
  first stage when querying the layer, the spatial filter is reduced to a
  single "tile bounds" filter. The "allowed area" or security filter has to be
  applied in-memory in a second stage, of course.</para>

  <para>This plugin has been successfully tested on a ESRI WFS server and
  Oracle database.</para>
