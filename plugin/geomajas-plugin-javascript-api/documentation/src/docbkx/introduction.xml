  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The goal of this plug-in is to provide a pure JavaScript API for the
  Geomajas client.</para>

  <para>By default, Geomajas uses the GWT technology to develop client side
  code in. Since the GWT Java code is by default compiled into unreadable and
  obfuscated JavaScript code, this plug-in basically provides a wrapper around
  the GWT code wherein names and packages are pre-defined.</para>

  <para>A secondary goal for this plug-in is to provide the same API for all
  Geomajas GWT based faces. This means that for all GWT based faces, there
  will be a different implementation using the same API.</para>

  <note>
    <para>At first this plug-in will focus on the implementation for the GWT
    face, later for the PureGWT face.</para>
