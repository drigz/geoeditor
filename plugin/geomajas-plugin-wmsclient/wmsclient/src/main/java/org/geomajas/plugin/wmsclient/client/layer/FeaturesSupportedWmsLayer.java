 * data set or a vector data set, we too make that distinction here. If you know that a WMS services uses a vector data
 * set, this layer implementation will give you some more options.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * These extra options include a WMS GetFeatureInfo request and general feature selection and filtering. Note though
 * that filtering is not a default WMS construct and may not always work. Some WMS servers will support it though.
